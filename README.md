What is Ames?
Ames is an effective and efficient aircraft maintenance scheduling tool designed to support decision-making in aviation maintenance planning.

Key Features
-Predictive Scheduling: Addresses the major blind spot of compliance systems, which cannot predict maintenance beyond the next check.
-Seamless Integration: Works alongside compliance systems to provide enhanced insights and future-focused planning.
-Decision Support: Equips users with smart tools needed to predict and optimize fleet maintenance plans.
-Efficiency & Accuracy: Ensures maintenance planning is both cost-effective and operationally reliable.

Project Goal
Our work will focus on exploring the Ames software and developing AI-based enhancements to create a chat assistant that helps users interact with Ames more effectively.
